# TODO 


### Decide on Models
- [ ] Base Case LR (1)
- [ ] Base Case GBT (3)
- [ ] SM LR, 
- [ ] SM LR DT, 
- [ ] SM LR ROF 
- [ ] SM GBT (3)
- [ ] SM GBT LR (3)
- [ ] SM GBT Norm (3)
- [ ] SM GBT Elev (3)
- [ ] Uncertainty ALD
  
This would result in 19 models...
How many max features for the linear regression models? 2, 3, 4 (i think it is very unlikely that 4 features have a high correlation - set to 4)? it is also coupled with a correlation threshold (set to 0.4 so far).

## Operationalize
- [ ] Integration of Meta-Model in Prediction Pipeline
- [ ] Integration of Uncertainty Net in Prediction Pipeline
- [ ] Decide on Models
- [ ] Release Version 0.1.0

## Fixes 
- [ ]

## Features (Needed)
- [ ] Plot Generation (workshop)
- [ ] Documentation

## Features (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Deep Learning Regressors
